# Aestroids
Making my first game Aestroids for my undergraduate degree at Swansea University. Module CSC-384 Introduction to Video Game Programming.


1- For the first coursework for this module, I had to make this game (Aestroids) where I implemented part of the game and uploaded code snippets on Canvas (University portal), This unlocked me to do the second coursework which was to review 5 peoples code nippets and give feedback on their coding principles.
